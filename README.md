 - Utilize the address space 10.10.0.0/23 for addressing needs.
 - Minimize the number of addresses used.
 - Configure separate local networks for Sales, Human Resources, and Administration departments in each branch.
 - Implement network isolation between local networks.
 - Set up file and web servers accessible to all company computers.
 - Deploy DHCP services hosted on the Sales router for IP configuration.
 - Establish a PPPoE connection with the Internet Service Provider.
 - Implement IP address translation (NAT) for LAN addresses to a single fixed public address.
 - Ensure minimal routing complexity, avoiding unnecessary transmission of routing information.
